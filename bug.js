The issue stems from an improper handling of asynchronous operations within a Firebase Cloud Function. Specifically, the function attempts to access and modify Firestore data before the asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from another service) has completed. This results in undefined values or stale data being used, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
